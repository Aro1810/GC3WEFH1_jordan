 2. Click on 'Create app' in the top right corner of the Streamlit dashboard
 3. Paste in the Github URL for this repo
 4. Select appropriate branch and main file path
 5. (Recommended) Rename the app URL to something meaninful
 6. Make sure to click on 'Advanced Settings' and choose Python version **3.11**. Then set the Google Gemini API key using the key generated by the GC3WEFH Google account.
 7. Deploy!

# Local Development
For working on code locally, you can just run
`streamlit run <name_of_app>.py`
e.g. `streamlit run main.py`.

Ensure that you have all necessary libraries by doing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Also make sure that you set up a `.env` file that contains the Google Gemini API Key. Contact an admin for access.
